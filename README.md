# Cashflow Board Game - Companion App

---

## Description

### Problem

When you want to play the board game [_Cashflow - How to get out of the rat race_](https://store.richdad.com/products/cashflow-board-game "CASHFLOW Board game (2020)") by the author Robert Kyosaki, you will encounter the problem of annoying calculations.
Because the game is about income and expenses, assets and liabilities, and the interaction of these, it forces you to do calculations **all the time**.

You could do them all by hand, but that will 
* increase the time spent playing this game and
* decrease the game fun.

### Motivation

Because the already [existing companion mobile app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cashflow-financial-statement-calculator/id419229056 "CASHFLOW Financial Statement Calculator") for this board game is 
1. old
2. not responsive
3. not well designed
4. and only for iOS devices

I wanted to develop a beautiful, responsive and intuitie web app which runs on every browser and operating system.

### Solution

It should calculate important measures of game progress (like assets, liabilities, income from salary and cash flow from assets, expenses from taxes, liabilities and other) so that the user can focus on the game and not the calculations.

The app should do that while also being very intuitively designed so that every user knows exactly what to do.

## Features

### Minimum Viable Product

>As a user, I want to see my (fictional) balance and be able to change it by getting income from payday and paying expenses.

>As a user, I want to see my collection of liabilities like mortgages and loans and be able to pay them off 

>As a user, I want to see my collection of assets like real estate, stocks, businesses and gold an be able to buy and sell these assets

### Nice-to-have features

* having a starting point where one could choose different jobs and so also different income starting levels
* switching from the inner ring of the board to the “fast track” (later in the game)
* being able to use only one device for the whole game, so that only one user operates the app (game master function)
* being able to connect different devices, so that everyone can see other players in his interface (multiplayer function)
